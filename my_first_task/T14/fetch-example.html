            /* To run this code:
            1. Copy 'Example 2' folder to your local machine.
            2. Navigate to this folder.
            4. You should now be able to execute this by opening it in a Chromium-based browser, pressing F12 and navigating to the
            console.
            
            In this example we use the Fetch API to fetch data about a book that is made available usign the Google Books API:
             https://developers.google.com/books/docs/static-links
            To see what is returned when we call the fetch() function, copy and paste the URL that is passed as an argument to the 
            fetch function into your browser.
            */

            // Create an array called 'items' - we will store the data that we retrieve using the fetch API in this variable.
            let items = [];

            /* 
              We use the fetch function below to fetch data using the argument specified (which is in this case is the URL 
              for the Google Books API which will return json about books). Remember that the fetch function returns a promise 
              that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not.  Remember that a promise basically
              allows the interpreter to carry on with other tasks while a function is executed without waiting for that function to 
              finish. This is because the promise, ‘promises’ to let you know the outcome of the function once it is finished. The 
              basic structure of a promise is: doSomething().then(successCallback, failureCallback);
              A promise uses callbacks to execute different functions based on whether the desired action succeeded or failed.

He is bullied by them and his fat, spoilt cousin Dudley, and lives a very unremarkable life with only the odd hiccup (like his hair growing back overnight!) to cause him much to think about. That is until an owl turns up with a letter addressed to Harry and all hell breaks loose! He is literally rescued by a world where nothing is as it seems and magic lessons are the order of the day. Read and find out how Harry discovers his true heritage at Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, the reason behind his parents mysterious death, who is out to kill him, and how he uncovers the most amazing secret of all time, the fabled Philosopher's Stone! All this and muggles too. Now, what are they?",
